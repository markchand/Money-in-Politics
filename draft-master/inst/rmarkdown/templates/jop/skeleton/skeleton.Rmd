Your introduction should go at the very beginning.
It should not have a section heading.
Note that your initial submission should be anonymized.
This is, in part (I cannot stop you from referencing your identity in the text),
enforced by the YAML option "anonymized", which is true by default.
If you set it to false, your name (as provided in the "author" option)
will be displayed via `\maketitle`.

Short article submissions must be 10 pages or less, including tables, figures,
footnotes, and references, but excluding the title page, abstract page,
and online appendix. Research articles must be 35 pages or less (same counting).

# Section headings should be short

Section headings should not take up more than a single line of text.
There should be no section heading for the introduction.
Do not use headings immediately after one another without text in between.
You generally should not use headings at the sub-sub-heading level or below.
Do not refer to sections by number, as sections are not numbered.
