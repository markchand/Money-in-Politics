The [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package provides an excellent suite of LaTeX journal article templates for R Markdown.
However, some journals do not have LaTeX templates, and yet require particular formatting for submission, such as double-spaced footnotes.
(Some examples are the [Journal of Politics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jop/instruct)
and the [American Journal of Political Science](https://ajps.org/guidelines-for-manuscripts/manuscript-preparation/).)

`draft` provides R Markdown templates for such submissions.
R Markdown templates slated to be added to the package so far include:

  - `ajps`: A template meeting the formatting guidelines for submissions to
     the [American Journal of Political Science](https://ajps.org/guidelines-for-manuscripts/manuscript-preparation/)
  - `jop`: A template meeting the formatting guidelines for submissions to
     the [Journal of Politics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jop/instruct)
  - `wp`: A general purpose template for working papers
